    <img src="../images/begul.jpeg" alt="Babi Guling images" height="400">
    <p>Babi Guling is a traditional Balinese dish that features a whole roasted pig, known for its rich flavors and cultural significance. The preparation of Babi Guling involves marinating the pig with a mixture of spices such as turmeric, coriander, lemongrass, and garlic, then slow-roasting it over an open fire. This meticulous cooking process results in tender, juicy meat and crispy, golden-brown skin. Often served during special ceremonies and celebrations, Babi Guling is accompanied by an array of side dishes including lawar (a Balinese salad), steamed rice, and spicy sambal. This iconic dish not only highlights the culinary artistry of Bali but also reflects the island's communal and festive spirit.</p>
