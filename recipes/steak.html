    <p>Steak is a premium cut of beef, renowned for its rich flavor and tender texture. Derived from various parts of the cow, such as the rib, loin, or round, each cut offers a unique culinary experience. Ribeye, known for its marbling and juiciness, delivers a robust taste, while the tenderloin, or filet mignon, is prized for its tenderness. The New York strip offers a balance of tenderness and flavor, making it a favorite among steak enthusiasts.    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak (ribeye, tenderloin, New York strip, or your preferred cut)</li>
        <li>Salt (preferably kosher salt)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steak from the refrigerator about 30-60 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. This ensures even cooking.</li>

        <li>Preheat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over high heat until its very hot. You can also use a grill if preferred.</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of high-smoke point oil (such as vegetable or olive oil) to the pan and heat until shimmering.</li>
